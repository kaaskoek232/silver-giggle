## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "CUDA not available" error
**Solution**: Ensure PyTorch with CUDA support is installed:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

**Issue**: Memory monitoring not working
**Solution**: Install psutil:
```bash
pip install psutil>=5.9.0
```

**Issue**: Memory leaks still occurring
**Solution**: 
1. Use Smart Memory Manager with "Aggressive" mode
2. Enable leak detection with auto-snapshots
3. Set lower memory thresholds (70% warning, 80% critical)

**Issue**: Performance impact from monitoring
**Solution**:
1. Increase check intervals (60-120 seconds)
2. Use "Conservative" management mode
3. Disable auto-snapshots if not needed

### Memory Management Best Practices

1. **Start with Smart Memory Manager** - Use the all-in-one solution first
2. **Monitor First** - Use Memory Monitor to understand your usage patterns
3. **Set Appropriate Thresholds** - Don't set thresholds too low (causes frequent cleanups)
4. **Use Leak Detection Sparingly** - Only enable during problem diagnosis
5. **Regular VRAM Optimization** - Include VRAM cleanup in your workflow
6. **Batch Processing** - Process large workflows in smaller batches
